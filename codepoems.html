<h1>Code Poems</h1>
<p><b>The Brief:</b>Start with the tools and technologies you find interesting, promising, compelling - in so many words, cool. How would you apply them, what would you like to create given a free reign? Limit yourself to one set of tools or one medium (Machine Learning, or Mediated Realities, or the Internet of Things, etc.). Clearly define your toolset and the goals you'd like to achieve in the scope of three weeks. Find some resources - documentations, tutorials, communities of practice - to help you with your experimentation. Make something.</p>
<p><b>My response:</b> For this project I wanted to work with code to make authored poems rather than random poems. I considered what kinds of coding strategies would make sense, and I settled on arrays for now..</p>
