<h1>Digital Twins</h1>
<h1>ErNoFa—A Blended Pop Star Made With Machine Learning</h1>
<p><b>The Brief:</b> Working in a team of 3, we created a digital twin model(s) using one another as our datasets and through various machine learning software examples. Using ourselves as a medium, how can we use machine learning to extend one another’s attributes, mix, mash, and collaborate and formulate new in-between aesthetics from these various processes?</p>
<p>Using a machine learning program calling RunwayML, our team decieded to use the Liquid Warping GAN as the basis for our porject. This machine learning program takes the movement of one reference and applies it to the second reference.</p>

<p><b>The Brief:</b>Because our datasets are limited to videos of ourselves—as shown above—we decided they were not of value to the public.</p>
