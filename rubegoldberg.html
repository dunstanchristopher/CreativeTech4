<h1>The Web as a Rube Goldberg Machine</h1>
<p><b>The Brief:</b> In the spirit of Rube Goldberg's fascination with the mechanism over the end result - how can we build similar systems in the digital realm? What kind of data could be passed around? With services could be chained together to produce some unexpected outcomes? What would the triggers look like - and the end results? None of those need to be practical, efficient or even reasonable - the focus is on the celebration of the chains of events and the mechanisms that enable them.</p>
